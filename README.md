# Project Name: Word-Guess-Game
The Word Guess Game is a cool game project that would challenge the player in guessing some random words.

## What the project does
This project is a game. In this game the computer randomly picks a word from the list of words that I created, and the user has to guess which word the computer chose.

## Why the project is useful
The project was helpful to get some practice using javascript functions, conditions(if/else), forloops, and so many other subjects.
